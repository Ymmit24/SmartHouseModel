<p>This webpage is an indicative demonstration of the possible functionality of a smart home</p>

<p>It was originally developed for the British Science fair in Birmingham 10th1/11th September 2014.</p>

<p>Initially, lights, heating and water heating are controlled from a webpage.  The demonstrator can also run in "normal operation" mode, where it runs a normal day, or be driven from a simulation created using the <a href="www.iesd.dmu.ac.uk/~cascade">CASCADE</a> framework developed within the Institute for Energy and Sustainable Development (IESD) at De Montfort University</p>

<p>In the academic year of 2020/2021 the smart house model was integrated to a final year project with the ultimate goal to improve upon the exsisting model by implementing an element of renewable energy generation coupled with am energy storage device.</p>
 
<p>After the latest work undertaken on the smart house during the final year project a full documentation including BOMs, schematics, code and other realted material was digitalise in a projet working directory availble for all intrested stakeholders for future development on the smart house</p>

<p>For more information about the smart home and access to the project directory, contact <a href="https://www.dmu.ac.uk/about-dmu/academic-staff/technology/richard-snape/j-richard-snape.aspx">Richard Snape</a></p>

<p>Over time, additional functionality will be added to both the demonstration model and this webpage</p>
